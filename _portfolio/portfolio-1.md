## Overview
This research aims to improve performance management decisions in hospital settings by developing decision models grounded in causal inference. 

## Authors
- **Student Author:** Jay Sakarvadia  
- **Faculty Mentor:** Dr. Reginald Silver  
- **Program:** OUR Summer Research Scholar  
- **College:** Belk College of Business  

## Research Approach
Causal insights are extracted from interdisciplinary literature in healthcare, business, and social sciences through a multi-faceted approach that includes:
- **High-performance machine reading systems** to identify and structure causal variables into knowledge graphs.
- **Knowledge graph-based reasoning systems** to uncover hidden causal relationships relevant to enterprise management.
- **Statistical causal inference techniques** to validate and refine these connections.

## Key Contributions
- **Synthesizing insights** from machine learning, knowledge graphs, and statistical inference.
- **Constructing synthetic counterfactuals** to enable rigorous causal analysis.
- **Providing actionable, scenario-specific recommendations** tailored to hospital performance goals.

## Impact
By applying these methodologies, this study aims to optimize decision-making processes in hospitals, ensuring that institutions can make data-driven choices to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
