## Abstract
Effective decision-making in complex environments, such as healthcare and business, requires more than intuitive cause-and-effect reasoning. This research aims to improve performance management decisions in hospital settings by developing decision models grounded in causal inference. Causal insights are extracted from interdisciplinary literature in healthcare, business, and social sciences through a multi-faceted approach that includes high-performance machine reading systems to identify and structure causal variables into knowledge graphs, knowledge graph-based reasoning systems to uncover hidden causal relationships relevant to enterprise management, and novel statistical causal inference techniques to validate and refine these connections. By synthesizing insights from these methodologies, we construct synthetic counterfactuals that allow for rigorous causal analysis, identifying the most effective actions aligned with specific performance objectives. This study ultimately seeks to optimize decision-making processes in hospitals by providing actionable, scenario-specific recommendations tailored to their performance goals.
