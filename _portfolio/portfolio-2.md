## Overview
Lithium-ion batteries, widely used in electric vehicles and consumer electronics, play a crucial role in modern energy storage. While efficient, their degradation over time reduces capacity, leading to safety risks and shorter lifespans. This study applies deep learning techniques to predict battery **State of Health (SOH)** with improved accuracy.
