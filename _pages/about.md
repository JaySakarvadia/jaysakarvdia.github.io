## **Hello!**  

I'm a **third-year student** at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science** and **Economics**, with a minor in **Statistics**.  

My academic journey has been shaped by diverse research experiences, including:  
- **Improving Hospital Performance Management via Decision Models Grounded in Causal Inference**  
- **Machine Learning Enabled Health Estimation for Lithium-Ion Batteries in Electric Vehicles**  
- **Optimizing Data Movement on Supercomputers for Deep Learning Model Training at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/)**  

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in **Causal Machine Learning** and am currently undertaking an **independent study**, where I am working through select chapters on **machine learning-enabled heterogeneous treatment effect estimation** from [CausalML](https://causalml-book.org/).  

Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a **Ph.D.** where I can integrate my interests in **machine learning, econometrics, and causal inference** to:  
- **Develop advanced methodologies** for understanding complex economic and social systems,  
- **Improve decision-making** through data-driven causal insights, and  
- **Contribute to both the theoretical and applied advancements of Causal AI** in policy, business, and science.  

### **Other Interests**  
Outside of research and academics, I enjoy:  
🎵 **Listening to music**  
✈️ **Traveling**  
🏋️ **Spending time in the gym**
