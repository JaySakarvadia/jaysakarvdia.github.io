## Hi, I'm Jay! Welcome to my personal website.  

I'm a third-year student at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/), pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science and Economics, with a minor in Statistics.  

My academic journey has been shaped by diverse research experiences, including:  
- Improving hospital performance management via decision models grounded in causal inference  
- Machine learning enabled health estimation for lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles  
- Optimizing data movement on supercomputers for deep learning model training at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/)  

Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in causal machine learning and am currently undertaking an independent study, where I am working through select chapters on machine learning-enabled heterogeneous treatment effect estimation from [CausalML](https://causalml-book.org/).  

Ultimately, my goal is to pursue a Ph.D. where I can integrate my interests in machine learning, econometrics, and causal inference to:  
- Develop advanced methodologies for understanding complex economic and social systems,  
- Improve decision-making through data-driven causal insights, and  
- Contribute to both the theoretical and applied advancements of causal AI in policy, business, and science.  

### Other Interests  
Outside of research and academics, I enjoy:  
🎵 Listening to music  
✈️ Traveling  
🏋️ Spending time in the gym
